Contributors: Aiza Bajwa, Katherine Ling, Elham Razi.  

This project is based on FairDeDup method proposed in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16123">paper</a>

Please find the main work in the `notebooks` folder.

## How to run
1. Download the `.ipynb` files in the `notebooks` folder.
2. Open the `.ipynb` files in Google Colab.

## Notes
1. **Data Access**: We assume you can access the MIMIC CXR embeddings and other required files (e.g., metadata, demographics).
2. **Starting Point**: We begin with the processed and merged dataset you get after running the pre-processing notebook (available on eClass).
3. **File Paths**: The notebooks reference file paths from our Google Drive setup. You may need to update the paths in the code to match wherever you upload your files.
